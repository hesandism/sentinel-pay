# SentinelPay

SentinelPay is a production-style machine-learning system that detects fraudulent card 
transactions in real time. Transactions flow through a streaming pipeline, get enriched with 
behavioural features (spending velocity, geographic distance from the last transaction, deviation from a card’s normal spend), and are scored by a gradient-boosted model served behind a low latency API. Every prediction comes with a SHAP explanation of why it was flagged. The system continuously monitors incoming data for drift, and when the model’s reliability decays it automatically retrains, validates, and promotes a new version - the full MLOps loop, not just a notebook. 

## Set Up

1. Manually download the train and test datasets from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection" and place them in the `data` folder. The datasets are too large to be included in this repository.

```
data
|__ fraudTest.csv
|__ fraudTrain.csv
```
2. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/activate 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
